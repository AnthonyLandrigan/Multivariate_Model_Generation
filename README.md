# Multivariate_Model_Generation
This repository contains the data and code for my project in BIOL 5930-01: Data Analysis. This project uses data extracted from a multispectral image pipeline to generate univariate and multivariate relationship matrices to be used in phenomic selection models. Work in progress.
