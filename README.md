# Multivariate Model Generation
This repository contains the data and code for my project in BIOL 5930-01: Data Analysis. This project uses data extracted from a multispectral image pipeline to generate univariate and multivariate relationship matrices to be used in phenomic selection models. Work in progress.

Question: Which models are best at predicting germination in _Silphium integrifolium_?

Explanatory variable: The univariate or multivariate relationship matrix

Response variable: The ability of a relationship matrix in a phenomic selection model to predict germination
